# AMKAT

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

AMKAT (short for Adaptive Multivariate Kernel-based Association Test) is
a flexible, nonparametric test for joint association between a
multivariate quantitative response and a high-dimensional set of
features. It includes the following notable features:

-   A feature selection method for filtering noise variables out of the
    feature set
-   A kernel-based test statistic that uses a different kernel function
    for each response variable, with a method for selecting each kernel
    function individually
-   A method of adjusting for covariate effects on the response
    variables
-   All significant computations performed using compiled C++ routines

## Installation

You can install the development version of AMKAT using the following
commands in `R`:

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("brianpatrickneal/AMKAT")

## Example

Testing is straightforward using the `amkat` function. Below, we
generate toy data for a set of feature variables (`x`) and for a set of
response variables (`y`), as well as for a set of covariates (`w`), and
test for joint association between the features and response:

``` r
library(AMKAT)
set.seed(42)
n <- 20 # sample size
y <- matrix(rnorm(3 * n), nrow = n, ncol = 3) # 3 response variables
x <- matrix(rnorm(50 * n), nrow = n, ncol = 50) # 50 feature variables
w <- matrix(rnorm(2 * n), nrow = n, ncol = 2) # 2 covariates
test_results <- amkat(y, x, covariates = w)
str(test_results)
